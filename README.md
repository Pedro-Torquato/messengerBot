This is a Python automation project that utilizes the Selenium and Pandas libraries to create a WhatsApp bot capable of sending messages to contacts stored in a spreadsheet.

## Key Features:

- **Contact Extraction:** The bot can read an Excel spreadsheet and extract the contacts listed in it for further interaction.

- **Sending Personalized Messages:** Based on the extracted contacts, the bot can send personalized messages to each of them. This can be useful for sending notifications, updates, or any other relevant information.

- **Complete Automation:** Once configured, the bot operates autonomously, sending messages on a scheduled basis without the need for manual intervention.

- **Ease of Use:** The project is developed with simplicity in mind, allowing other developers to use it as a base for their own automations or customizations.
